    "1. The problem we are exploring is hotel reservation cancellations. Hotels typically offer free or low-charge cancellation services that may result in loss of profit if abused by customers. If hotels were able to predict the likelihood of cancellation given certain booking details, they may be able to modify their cancellation policy to minimize loss based on customer-specific booking information. Thus, our research question is: What predictors are most indicative that a customer will cancer their reservation?\n",
    "2. This is a classification problem because the response variable we are interested in is whether a customer cancels their hotel reservation or not, which is categorical variable. \n",
    "3. This is an inference problem because we want to analyze the relationship between customer booking characteristics and their likelihood of canceling their hotel reservation to see which predictors have a statistically significant relationship with cancellations. It is also a prediction problem because we want to build a model to predict the likelihood of any random customer canceling their hotel reservation.\n",
    "4. To assess our model's accuracy, we will prioritize limiting false negative rates (predicting that customers will cancel when they really don't) while also maintaining a reasonable false positive rate (predicting they won't cancel and they really do). This will make sure that the hotel minimize their loss when people cancel their reservation.\n",
    "5. We'll probably have to decrease the number of predictors we consider through variable selection to ensure that our model only considers statistically significant predictors. We might also have to transform variables to improve the fit of our model after exploring the nature of the relationship between the response and each predictor."

In particular, we will use our past data to identify characteristics of bookings that are most likely to be cancelled. Then, using this data, the hotel can charge a higher nonrefundable deposit for customers that are more likely cancel than those who do not. This would benefit the hotel by minimizing the probability of having empty rooms and losing revenue. However, we also want to note to the hotel chain that charging people with a higher nonrefundable deposit will make customers less willing to book the hotel because the stake is higher."
