    "\n",
    "Currently, most hotels overbook anywhere between 2%, 3%, up to 10%, and 15%. The higher the overbooking percentage, the more likely a customer is to have to be rebooked to a different hotel. This would lead to customers dissatisfaction due to the constant moving pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "The true positive rate is aroun 60%, which means that 60% of the customers predicted to cancel will cancel. To edge on the safer end, we would recommend overbooking approximately 50% the number of customers predicted to cancel for the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the true negative rate or the specificity of the model is 1 - FPR = ~90%, which means that approximately 90% of customers predicted to not cancel follow through with their reservation. This means that using our model, we will miss guess around 10% of customers who are going to follow through. Once again, to edge on the safer end, we would recommend overbooking approximately 2% the number of customers predicted to follow through for the night. This would be best for the hotel to maximizes the profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we would recommend that the customer round down the number of rooms to overbook, just to edge on the safer side"
